  "opportunity_level": "High",
  "primary_service_angle": "Conversion optimization",
  "audit_summary": "Woodfire Westport has strong public reputation signals with 573 Google reviews and a near-perfect desktop performance score, but the website currently offers no contact form or booking system — leaving visitors with no direct way to engage. This is the most significant conversion gap across all signals and should be treated as an immediate priority. Adding even a basic enquiry pathway would directly leverage the reputational traffic the business is already generating.",
  "findings": {
    "performance": [
      "Mobile PageSpeed score of 74 indicates moderate performance and sits one point below the strong threshold — possible contributing factors include unoptimised images or render-blocking scripts, though this cannot be confirmed from public signals alone",
      "Desktop PageSpeed score of 99 is strong — the core build is technically well-optimised"
    ],
    "mobile_ux": [
      "Mobile UX is rated ok — the site is functional on mobile, but the absence of any contact or booking pathway means mobile visitors have no conversion route regardless of usability",
      "Adding a prominent click-to-call button and an enquiry or booking CTA as immediate priorities would address both the UX friction and the conversion gap simultaneously"
    ],
    "conversion": [
      "No contact form is present — visitors currently have no way to send a direct enquiry from the website",
      "No booking or reservation system is present — for a hospitality business with 573 reviews this is a critical conversion gap",
      "Notes confirm no online ordering or booking system is visible and the single-page layout offers no dedicated conversion sections"
    ],
    "seo_fundamentals": [
      "No blog or updates section is present — the site offers no dynamic content to support ongoing search visibility",
      "Notes confirm a single-page layout with minimal content depth and no dedicated about section — limited indexable content reduces keyword reach",
      "Notes explicitly state limited structured SEO content — local schema markup and on-page improvements would strengthen local search appearance"
    ],
    "trust_social_proof": [
      "4.6 Google rating across 573 reviews is an exceptionally strong trust signal and represents significant earned credibility",
      "This social proof is not visibly surfaced on the website — embedding a Google Reviews widget would convert this reputational asset into an on-site conversion tool"
    ],
    "security_maintenance": [
      "SSL is active — secure browsing is in place",
      "Site runs on WordPress — keeping themes, plugins, and core updated on a regular schedule is recommended to maintain stability and performance"
    ]
  },
  "prioritised_recommendations": {
    "p1_quick_wins": [
      "Add a contact form or enquiry button immediately — this is the most urgent gap and currently leaves visitors with no way to engage with the business from the website",
      "Add a click-to-call button visible on mobile — lowest-effort conversion addition for a restaurant audience browsing on the go"
    ],
    "p2_growth_improvements": [
      "Add an online booking or reservation system — directly converts the strong review-driven traffic into seated customers",
      "Embed a Google Reviews widget to surface the 573-review, 4.6-rating social proof on the site itself",
      "Review mobile PageSpeed — targeted image compression could push the score from moderate to strong with minimal structural change"
    ],
    "p3_strategic_enhancements": [
      "Expand from single-page to multi-page structure to support deeper SEO coverage, add an about section, and better reflect the full offering to new visitors",
      "Introduce LocalBusiness and Restaurant schema markup to strengthen local search appearance given the notes indicate limited structured SEO content currently"
    ]
  },
  "assumptions_and_unknowns": [
    "Hosting provider is unknown",
    "Social media links and profiles were not included in the input",
    "Schema markup presence cannot be confirmed from public signals alone",
    "Online ordering capability was noted as absent in the notes field — confirmed as not present"
  ],
  "next_best_action": "Make contact immediately with a short pitch focused on adding a booking or enquiry system — this is an urgent conversion gap for a business with 573 reviews already driving traffic to a site that offers no way to act on it"
