  "opportunity_level": "Medium",
  "primary_service_angle": "Conversion optimization",
  "audit_summary": "Arnos Bistrot has a well-maintained WordPress website with strong desktop performance and excellent Google review signals. The primary opportunity is the absence of an online booking or reservation pathway, which is a clear gap for a hospitality business with demonstrated demand. Secondary improvements to mobile performance and testimonial integration would further strengthen conversion.",
  "findings": {
    "performance": [
      "Mobile PageSpeed score of 65 indicates moderate performance — possible causes include unoptimised images or render-blocking scripts, though this cannot be confirmed from public signals alone",
      "Desktop PageSpeed score of 98 is strong and suggests the core site build is well-optimised"
    ],
    "mobile_ux": [
      "Mobile UX is rated ok — the site is usable on mobile but may have friction points such as small tap targets, dense text, or CTA placement that could reduce conversion on smaller screens",
      "Reviewing button sizing, spacing, and CTA prominence on mobile would support the conversion objective"
    ],
    "conversion": [
      "Contact form is present — basic enquiry pathway is in place",
      "No booking system is present — for a hospitality business this is the most direct conversion gap",
      "No click-to-call functionality was identified in the input signals"
    ],
    "seo_fundamentals": [
      "No blog or updates section is present — static content structure limits fresh content signals",
      "Notes confirm no dynamic content section, which reduces opportunities for ongoing organic visibility",
      "Location data is available (Westport, Co. Mayo) — local business schema markup would likely improve local search appearance but is not confirmed as present"
    ],
    "trust_social_proof": [
      "Google rating of 4.9 across 293 reviews is a strong trust signal",
      "Testimonials are manually displayed rather than dynamically embedded — this is a missed opportunity to surface live review data and reduce maintenance overhead"
    ],
    "security_maintenance": [
      "SSL is active — secure browsing is in place",
      "Site runs on WordPress — keeping themes, plugins, and core updated is recommended as a routine maintenance practice to maintain performance and stability"
    ]
  },
  "prioritised_recommendations": {
    "p1_quick_wins": [
      "Add an online booking or reservation system — this is the highest-priority conversion improvement for a hospitality business with strong review demand",
      "Replace manually displayed testimonials with a dynamically embedded Google Reviews widget to surface live social proof without ongoing manual effort"
    ],
    "p2_growth_improvements": [
      "Investigate and address mobile PageSpeed — image compression and deferring non-critical scripts are common quick gains that could move the score from moderate to strong",
      "Add a click-to-call button visible on mobile — low effort and directly supports conversion for walk-in and reservation enquiries",
      "Implement LocalBusiness and Restaurant schema markup to strengthen local search appearance"
    ],
    "p3_strategic_enhancements": [
      "Introduce a lightweight specials or events section to generate periodic fresh content — low editorial commitment and supports long-term local SEO visibility"
