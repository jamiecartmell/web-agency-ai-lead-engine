  "business_name": "Woodfire Westport",
  "proposal_type": "Conversion Sprint",
  "problem_summary": "Woodfire Westport has 573 Google reviews at a 4.6 rating — a strong public reputation that is already driving traffic to the website. The site currently has no contact form, booking system, or click-to-call button, meaning visitors who arrive with intent to enquire or reserve have no way to act from the site itself. Addressing this is the single highest-impact improvement available and does not require any structural changes to the existing build.",
  "recommended_solution": "A focused Conversion Sprint to add an enquiry form, click-to-call button, and online reservation system — giving visitors a clear and direct path to contact or book, and putting the existing review-driven traffic to practical use.",
  "scope_of_work": [
    "Add a contact or enquiry form to the homepage with email notification and confirmation response",
    "Implement a click-to-call button visible on mobile, positioned prominently for on-the-go visitors",
    "Integrate an online reservation or booking system with a confirmation flow and calendar management"
  ],
  "expected_outcomes": [
    "Visitors arriving via Google search or review platforms should have a direct way to enquire or reserve without needing to call or visit in person",
    "Mobile conversion is likely to improve as visitors browsing on the go can act immediately from the site",
    "The 573-review reputation already earned on Google should translate more directly into measurable site interactions"
  ],
  "timeline_estimate": "1 to 2 weeks",
  "engagement_model": "One-time project",
  "next_steps": "Schedule a 15 minute call this week to confirm the preferred booking system, agree the contact form placement, and set a start date.",
  "risks_if_delayed": "Every week without a contact or booking pathway means reputation-driven visitors continue to have no direct route to engage — and the gap between the business's public credibility and its website remains unresolved."
