  "commercial_risk_if_unaddressed": "Woodfire Westport has 573 Google reviews driving a steady flow of reputation-led traffic to a website that currently offers no contact form, no booking system, and no enquiry pathway. Every visitor who cannot act on that intent is a potential customer lost to a competitor who makes the next step easier. This is an active and ongoing conversion loss, not a future risk.",
  "strongest_positioning_angle": "With 573 Google reviews and a 4.6 rating, Woodfire Westport is already generating significant reputation-driven traffic — the urgent opportunity is giving those visitors somewhere to go by adding a basic contact or booking pathway before competitors with comparable ratings do.",
  "top_3_outreach_talking_points": [
    "You have 573 Google reviews — one of the strongest local restaurant profiles we have come across — but the website currently has no way for visitors to book, enquire, or even call directly. Adding a contact form and booking system would immediately put that reputation to work.",
    "A click-to-call button alone is one of the lowest-effort, highest-return additions for a restaurant website — mobile users looking to check availability or make a reservation expect to be able to tap and call in seconds.",
    "Embedding your Google Reviews on the site rather than leaving them only on Google means new visitors see your reputation the moment they land — not just the ones who already searched for you specifically."
  ],
  "likely_objections": [
    "We are very busy already and do not need more bookings right now",
    "Customers can find us on Google — the website is just there for information",
    "We do not want to add anything that takes time to manage",
    "We have been meaning to update the site but have not had time"
  ],
  "recommended_offer_angle": "Lead with an urgent, minimal-commitment entry offer: a contact form, click-to-call button, and embedded Google Reviews widget — positioned as a quick conversion fix that takes days not weeks and requires no ongoing management from the owner. Frame it as closing a gap that is actively costing bookings right now, with the booking system as a clear natural next step.",
  "unknowns_to_clarify": [
    "Does the business currently take bookings by phone, walk-in only, or through a third-party platform — this determines which booking solution to recommend",
    "Is there an active social media presence that could be linked from the site and used to support a content strategy",
    "Is the owner aware the website has no contact or enquiry pathway, or has this not been flagged before",
    "What is the hosting setup — WordPress theme, hosting provider, and maintenance history would inform a scoped maintenance recommendation"
