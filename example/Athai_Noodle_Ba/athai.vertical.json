    "Online table booking and reservation pathway",
    "Mobile conversion for on-the-go diners",
    "Surfacing review credibility directly on the site",
    "Click-to-call accessibility for quick enquiries",
    "Local search visibility for dining intent queries"
  ],
  "likely_customer_intent": [
    "Find a well-reviewed local restaurant for a specific occasion",
    "Book a table online quickly without calling",
    "Browse the menu before visiting",
    "Check opening hours, location, and contact details on mobile",
    "Read reviews to confirm the restaurant meets their expectations"
  ],
  "commercial_risk_if_unaddressed": "The current site is well-positioned and performing effectively across all primary conversion and performance signals. The main longer-term risk is allowing the site to become stale — particularly on content freshness and schema markup — as competitors with growing review counts and active content strategies could gradually close the gap in local search visibility.",
  "strongest_positioning_angle": "a Thai Noodle Bar has a technically strong, well-converting website with a solid review profile — the opportunity is in protecting and extending that position through ongoing maintenance and schema improvements rather than addressing urgent gaps.",
  "top_3_outreach_talking_points": [
    "Your website is performing well — booking system in place, strong mobile experience, and a 4.6 Google rating. We work with hospitality businesses to make sure that strong foundation continues to work as the site matures, with proactive WordPress maintenance and targeted improvements to local search visibility.",
    "Adding LocalBusiness and Restaurant schema markup is a low-effort improvement that strengthens how your site appears in local search results — it does not change the design and typically takes less than a day to implement.",
    "Confirming your Google Reviews are dynamically surfaced on the site ensures your social proof stays current without manual updates — a small change that keeps your credibility visible to every new visitor."
  ],
  "likely_objections": [
    "The site is already working well and we are happy with it",
    "We do not want to change anything that might break what is already working",
    "We handle everything through our current developer",
    "We are not looking to invest in the website right now"
  ],
  "recommended_offer_angle": "Position a low-touch maintenance and optimisation retainer: WordPress care plan plus a one-time schema and review embedding setup. Frame it as protecting and extending a strong existing position — not fixing problems — with a clear monthly cost and no lock-in. This suits the low-opportunity profile and keeps the relationship open for a larger engagement later.",
  "unknowns_to_clarify": [
    "Is the blog signal inconsistency resolved — the structured input and notes contradict each other on whether a blog section exists, which should be confirmed before outreach",
    "Does the business have an existing WordPress developer or maintenance arrangement in place",
    "Are Google Reviews currently embedded dynamically on the site or managed manually",
    "Is LocalBusiness and Restaurant schema markup already implemented — this cannot be confirmed from public signals alone"
