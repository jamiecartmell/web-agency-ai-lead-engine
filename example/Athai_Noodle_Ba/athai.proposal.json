  "business_name": "a Thai Noodle Bar",
  "proposal_type": "Maintenance Retainer",
  "problem_summary": "a Thai Noodle Bar has a well-performing WordPress website with strong mobile scores, a booking system, and clear conversion pathways already in place. The site is technically sound, but ongoing WordPress maintenance is required to sustain that performance level — and two small improvements, local schema markup and confirming dynamic Google Reviews embedding, remain unaddressed.",
  "recommended_solution": "A monthly WordPress care plan covering routine maintenance and scheduled updates, with a one-time setup of LocalBusiness schema markup and Google Reviews dynamic embedding included in the first month.",
  "scope_of_work": [
    "Monthly WordPress core, theme, and plugin updates on a scheduled basis to maintain performance and stability",
    "One-time implementation of LocalBusiness and Restaurant schema markup to strengthen local search appearance",
    "Confirm and set up dynamic Google Reviews embedding if reviews are currently managed manually, ensuring social proof stays current without ongoing effort"
  ],
  "expected_outcomes": [
    "Routine WordPress maintenance is likely to prevent the performance degradation that can occur over time as plugins and themes fall out of date",
    "LocalBusiness schema markup should improve how a Thai Noodle Bar appears in local search results for dining queries in the Westport area",
    "Dynamic Google Reviews embedding reduces ongoing manual effort and ensures the 4.6 rating remains consistently visible to new visitors"
  ],
  "timeline_estimate": "Ongoing monthly retainer, schema and reviews setup in week 1",
  "engagement_model": "Monthly retainer",
  "next_steps": "Schedule a light review call to confirm the current WordPress setup, check the schema requirements, and agree a monthly maintenance schedule.",
  "risks_if_delayed": "Without a maintenance plan, the current strong performance baseline is not actively protected — and the two small open improvements continue to leave marginal local search visibility on the table."
