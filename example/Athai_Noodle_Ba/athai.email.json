The main thing worth keeping an eye on is ongoing WordPress maintenance, as sites with a strong setup like yours benefit from regular updates to stay performing at that level.\n\nThere are also a couple of small additions — local schema markup and confirming your Google Reviews are dynamically embedded — that are low effort and would strengthen how the site appears in local search.\n\nI offer a monthly WordPress care plan that covers routine maintenance and picks up improvements like these as part of the service. Happy to set up a light review call if that sounds like something worth a conversation.\n\nBest regards\n[Your name]",

The care plan I mentioned covers routine WordPress maintenance alongside a couple of low-effort improvements to local search visibility — schema markup and confirming your Google Reviews are displaying dynamically. No commitment involved in having a conversation. Is this something you would be open to looking at?",
