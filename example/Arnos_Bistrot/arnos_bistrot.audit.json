  "primary_service_angle": "Conversion optimization",
  "audit_summary": "Arnos Bistrot has a well-maintained WordPress website with strong desktop performance, an active booking system, and excellent Google review signals. The primary opportunity is to surface that 4.9 Google rating dynamically on the site rather than relying on manually displayed testimonials, and to add a content section to support ongoing local search visibility. Mobile performance and click-to-call also represent secondary improvements.",
  "findings": {
    "performance": [
      "Mobile PageSpeed score of 65 indicates moderate performance — possible causes include unoptimised images or render-blocking scripts, though this cannot be confirmed from public signals alone",
      "Desktop PageSpeed score of 98 is strong and suggests the core site build is well-optimised"
    ],
    "mobile_ux": [
      "Mobile UX is rated ok — the site is usable on mobile but may have friction points such as small tap targets, dense text, or CTA placement that could reduce conversion on smaller screens",
      "Reviewing button sizing, spacing, and CTA prominence on mobile would support the conversion objective"
    ],
    "conversion": [
      "Contact form is present — basic enquiry pathway is in place",
      "Booking system is present — the primary reservation pathway for a hospitality business is in place",
      "No click-to-call functionality was identified in the input signals — adding this would complete the mobile enquiry pathway"
    ],
    "seo_fundamentals": [
      "No blog or updates section is present — static content structure limits fresh content signals",
      "Notes confirm no dynamic content section, which reduces opportunities for ongoing organic visibility",
      "Location data is available (Westport, Co. Mayo) — local business schema markup would likely improve local search appearance but is not confirmed as present"
    ],
    "trust_social_proof": [
      "Google rating of 4.9 across 293 reviews is a strong trust signal",
      "Testimonials are manually displayed rather than dynamically embedded — this is a missed opportunity to surface live review data and reduce maintenance overhead"
    ],
    "security_maintenance": [
      "SSL is active — secure browsing is in place",
      "Site runs on WordPress — keeping themes, plugins, and core updated is recommended as a routine maintenance practice to maintain performance and stability"
    ]
  },
  "prioritised_recommendations": {
    "p1_quick_wins": [
      "Replace manually displayed testimonials with a dynamically embedded Google Reviews widget to surface the 4.9 rating and 293 reviews automatically without ongoing manual effort",
      "Add a click-to-call button visible on mobile — low effort and directly supports conversion for visitors browsing on the go"
    ],
    "p2_growth_improvements": [
      "Investigate and address mobile PageSpeed — image compression and deferring non-critical scripts are common quick gains that could move the score from moderate to strong",
      "Implement LocalBusiness and Restaurant schema markup to strengthen local search appearance",
      "Introduce a lightweight specials or events section to generate periodic fresh content and support ongoing local SEO visibility"
    ],
    "p3_strategic_enhancements": [
      "Add a blog or updates section with a low-commitment content plan — service highlights, seasonal menus, or local events would support long-term organic search visibility"
    ]
  },
  "assumptions_and_unknowns": [
    "Hosting provider is unknown",
    "Click-to-call presence was not confirmed in input signals",
    "Social media links and profiles were not included in the input",
    "Full mobile layout details such as font sizes and tap target sizes were not available — mobile UX assessment is based on the provided rating only"
  ],
  "next_best_action": "Share a short improvement plan focused on dynamically embedding the Google Reviews and adding a click-to-call button, and propose a short call to discuss how a content section could support ongoing local search visibility"
