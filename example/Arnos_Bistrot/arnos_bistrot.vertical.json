  "commercial_risk_if_unaddressed": "Arnos Bistrot has strong conversion infrastructure in place with a booking system and contact form, but the 4.9 Google rating across 293 reviews is only displayed manually rather than dynamically embedded — reducing the visibility and credibility of that trust signal for new visitors. Without a content section, the site also has limited ongoing search visibility for a business with this level of local demand.",
  "strongest_positioning_angle": "Arnos Bistrot already has the booking system and review credibility that most competitors lack — the opportunity is making that reputation visible and searchable by embedding reviews dynamically and adding a lightweight content section.",
  "top_3_outreach_talking_points": [
    "With 293 Google reviews and a 4.9 rating, you have one of the strongest reputations of any restaurant in Westport — embedding those reviews dynamically on the site means every new visitor sees that social proof the moment they land, rather than only those who already searched for you on Google.",
    "A lightweight content section covering specials, seasonal menus, or local events would give the site regular fresh signals and help it appear for more local dining searches without significant ongoing effort from you.",
    "Adding a click-to-call button on mobile is one of the lowest-effort improvements available — for a restaurant audience browsing on the go, being able to call in one tap removes a step that costs bookings."

  "likely_objections": [
    "The website is already working fine and we get good bookings through it",
    "We do not have time to write content or maintain a blog",
    "We are already listed on Google and people can find our reviews there",

  "recommended_offer_angle": "Lead with a trust and visibility package: dynamically embed Google Reviews, add a click-to-call button, and set up a lightweight content section with an initial batch of posts. Frame it as making the existing strong foundation work harder — not adding complexity — with a clear fixed scope and a low ongoing content commitment.",
  "unknowns_to_clarify": [
    "Is there a click-to-call button currently visible on mobile, as this was not confirmed in the input signals",
