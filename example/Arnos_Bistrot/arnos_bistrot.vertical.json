  "commercial_risk_if_unaddressed": "With no online booking system in place, Arnos Bistrot is likely losing reservation intent to competitors who offer a direct booking pathway — particularly from mobile users who expect to complete the action in the moment. A 4.9 Google rating across 293 reviews is generating significant trust, but without a booking CTA, that traffic has nowhere to convert.",
  "strongest_positioning_angle": "Arnos Bistrot has one of the strongest review profiles in its local area — a 4.9 rating across 293 reviews — but the website currently cannot convert that credibility into reservations because there is no online booking system.",
  "top_3_outreach_talking_points": [
    "With 293 Google reviews and a 4.9 rating, you have exceptional social proof driving people to your website — adding an online booking system would let that reputation directly fill tables without relying on phone calls or third-party platforms.",
    "Most restaurant bookings today start on a mobile device — your site performs reasonably well on mobile, and adding a prominent reservation button would give those visitors an immediate path to action.",
    "Embedding your Google Reviews directly on the site rather than displaying them manually means your social proof stays current automatically and carries more weight with new visitors comparing their options."
  ],
  "likely_objections": [
    "We take bookings over the phone and it works well enough",
    "We are already listed on third-party booking platforms",
    "We tried a booking plugin before and it caused issues with the site",
    "We do not have time to manage another system"
  ],
  "recommended_offer_angle": "Lead with a focused booking conversion package: integrate an online reservation system, add a click-to-call button, and embed Google Reviews dynamically. Frame this as a single-outcome project — more direct bookings without relying on third-party platforms — with a clear fixed price and minimal ongoing management required from the owner.",
  "unknowns_to_clarify": [
    "Is the business currently listed on any third-party booking platform such as OpenTable or Bookatable — if so, direct integration may be preferred over a standalone booking system",
    "How many reservations per week currently come via phone versus walk-in — this helps frame the value of an online booking pathway",
    "Is there a click-to-call button currently visible on mobile, as this was not confirmed in the input signals",
    "Does the business have active social media profiles that could be linked from the site to support local visibility"
