  "what_matters_in_this_vertical": [
    "Local discoverability through Google search and maps",
    "Clear display of menu, opening hours, and location",
    "Mobile-friendly experience for on-the-go visitors",
    "Google Business Profile and review presence",
    "Simple contact or booking pathway for new customers"
  ],
  "likely_customer_intent": [
    "Find a cafe nearby that is open and worth visiting",
    "Check the menu and opening hours before travelling",
    "Read reviews to decide whether to visit",
    "Get directions or call ahead to check availability",
    "Find a local cafe for a meeting, event, or specific occasion"
  ],
  "commercial_risk_if_unaddressed": "Without a website or Google Business listing, Example Cafe is completely absent from local search results — any potential customer searching for a cafe in Westport online will not find this business. Every competitor with even a basic web presence or Google listing has a structural discoverability advantage.",
  "strongest_positioning_angle": "Example Cafe is an active local business with no online presence — establishing a website and Google Business Profile would create immediate discoverability in a market where most searches for local hospitality businesses begin online.",
  "top_3_outreach_talking_points": [
    "Most people looking for a cafe in Westport will search on Google before deciding where to go — without a website or Google Business listing, Example Cafe does not appear in those results at all, regardless of how good the offering is.",
    "Setting up a Google Business Profile is free and takes days, not weeks — but pairing it with a simple website means customers can check your menu, hours, and location before visiting, which directly reduces friction for first-time visitors.",
    "A new website for a local cafe does not need to be complex — a clean, mobile-first site with your menu, location, and a click-to-call button is often enough to establish a strong local presence and start accumulating Google Reviews."
  ],
  "likely_objections": [
    "We get enough customers through word of mouth and do not need a website",
    "We are too busy running the cafe to deal with a website right now",
    "We tried to set something up before and it was complicated",
    "We cannot afford a website at the moment"
  ],
  "recommended_offer_angle": "Position a starter web presence package: a simple mobile-first website plus Google Business Profile setup, framed as a single combined project with a fixed price and no ongoing obligation. Emphasise that the result is immediate local search visibility — not a complex or ongoing commitment.",
  "unknowns_to_clarify": [
    "Does the business have any existing social media accounts that could be linked from the new website and used as early trust signals",
    "Does the cafe operate as walk-in only or would a table booking or reservation system be relevant",
    "Is there an existing Google Business listing that was missed during research, or has the business previously had a website",
    "What is the owner's appetite for ongoing content updates or would a purely static site be preferred"
