For a local hospitality business, that is the most straightforward gap to address.\n\nI work with small businesses in the west of Ireland on exactly this — building simple, well-structured websites and setting up Google Business profiles as a combined starter package. It is a fixed-scope project, typically completed in two to three weeks, and requires minimal ongoing effort from you once it is live.\n\nWould you have 15 minutes this week for a quick call so I can walk you through what is involved and what it would cost?\n\nBest regards\n[Your name]",
