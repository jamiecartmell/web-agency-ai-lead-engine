  "angle_summary": "Core Health and Performance has a perfect 5.0 Google rating but a static, single-page site with no blog or content section — the primary gap limiting organic search visibility for a health and fitness business. Adding a content section and local schema markup would directly improve discoverability for prospective clients searching for fitness services in Westport.",
  "proof_points": [
    "No blog or updates section is present — a static single-page layout with no dynamic content section limits indexable pages and keyword coverage",
    "5.0 Google rating across 53 reviews confirms strong local credibility, but testimonials are manually displayed rather than dynamically embedded",
    "Mobile PageSpeed of 63 indicates moderate mobile performance on a Wix platform where content and image settings are within the owner's control"

  "recommended_offer_type": "Local SEO starter (schema, pages, content plan)",
  "offer_scope_points": [
    "Set up a blog or content section with an initial 3 to 5 posts covering fitness tips, service overviews, or client success themes",
    "Implement LocalBusiness schema markup relevant to health and fitness to strengthen local search appearance",
    "Replace manually displayed testimonials with a dynamically embedded Google Reviews widget to surface the 5.0 rating automatically"

  "personalisation_notes": [
    "Perfect 5.0 Google rating across 53 reviews is a rare and credible trust signal for a health and fitness business — it should be the opening hook in any outreach message",
    "Site runs on Wix with a single-page static layout — this context is useful for scoping realistic SEO improvements within the platform's constraints"

  "avoid_saying": [
    "Anything critical of Wix as a platform — platform limitations are real but raising this risks triggering defensiveness from an owner who chose and invested in Wix",
    "Overpromising SEO outcomes or suggesting a specific ranking position — health and fitness SEO timelines vary and making promises undermines credibility"

  "unknowns_to_confirm": [
    "Is there an active social media presence that could provide initial content for the blog section — this significantly reduces the effort and cost of the starter content plan",
    "Is the business open to expanding beyond the current single-page structure or does the owner prefer to stay within the existing Wix layout"
