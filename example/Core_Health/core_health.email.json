The main gap I noticed is the absence of a blog or content section, which limits how often the site surfaces for relevant local searches beyond your existing audience.\n\nI work with health and wellness businesses on local SEO improvements — specifically setting up a content section, adding structured schema markup, and embedding Google Reviews dynamically. This is a defined starter package, typically completed in two weeks, that creates an ongoing foundation for organic visibility.\n\nIf it would help, I am happy to send over a short walkthrough of what that would look like for a business like yours.\n\nBest regards\n[Your name]",

The core opportunity I mentioned — adding a content section and local schema markup — is a defined, fixed-scope project that would help the site surface for more local searches without requiring ongoing effort from you. Happy to put together a short outline if that would be easier to review. Is this something worth exploring over the coming months?",
