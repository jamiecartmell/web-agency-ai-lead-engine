  "primary_service_angle": "SEO optimization",
  "audit_summary": "Core Health and Performance has a clean, well-presented website with a perfect Google rating and solid desktop performance. The primary opportunity is the absence of a content or blog section, which limits ongoing search visibility for a health and fitness business. Adding a content section alongside an online booking pathway would directly address the two most actionable gaps.",
  "findings": {
    "performance": [
      "Mobile PageSpeed score of 63 indicates moderate performance — possible contributing factors include platform script overhead or unoptimised images, though this cannot be confirmed from public signals alone",
      "Desktop PageSpeed score of 93 is strong — the core build performs well on desktop"
    ],
    "mobile_ux": [
      "Mobile UX is rated ok — the site is functional on mobile but may have friction points affecting new client conversion",
      "For a health and fitness business, ensuring consultation CTAs and contact options are prominent and easily tappable on mobile would support the enquiry pathway"
    ],
    "conversion": [
      "Contact form is present — a basic enquiry pathway is in place",
      "No booking or consultation system is present — for a health and fitness business this limits the ability of new clients to take a direct next step",
      "No click-to-call functionality was identified in the input signals"
    ],
    "seo_fundamentals": [
      "No blog or updates section is present — this is the primary SEO gap for a health and professional business where content authority and freshness directly support search visibility",
      "Notes confirm a single-page static layout with no dynamic content section — limited content depth reduces the number of indexable pages and keyword targets",
      "Location data available (Westport, Co. Mayo) — LocalBusiness schema markup relevant to health and fitness would strengthen local search appearance if not already implemented"
    ],
    "trust_social_proof": [
      "Perfect 5.0 Google rating across 53 reviews is an exceptional trust signal for a health business",
      "Testimonials are manually displayed per notes — dynamically embedding live Google Reviews would surface this strong social proof more effectively and reduce ongoing manual effort"
    ],
    "security_maintenance": [
      "SSL is active — secure browsing is in place",
      "Site runs on Wix — platform-level infrastructure is managed by Wix, though content freshness, image optimisation, and page structure remain within the owner's control"

  },
  "prioritised_recommendations": {
    "p1_quick_wins": [
      "Add a blog or content section covering fitness tips, client stories, or service updates — this is the most direct action to improve organic search visibility for a health business",
      "Replace manually displayed testimonials with a dynamically embedded Google Reviews widget to surface the perfect 5.0 rating automatically"
    ],
    "p2_growth_improvements": [
      "Add an online consultation or booking request system — reduces friction for new clients and supports conversion from search traffic",
      "Review mobile performance settings within Wix, particularly image sizing and lazy loading, to move the mobile score from moderate to strong",
      "Implement LocalBusiness and relevant health business schema markup to strengthen local search appearance"
    ],
