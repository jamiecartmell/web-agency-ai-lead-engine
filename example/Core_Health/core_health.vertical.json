    "Online booking for consultations and sessions",

  "likely_customer_intent": [
    "Find a local fitness or health specialist they can trust",
    "Understand what services and programmes are available",
    "Read reviews or testimonials before making contact",
    "Book an initial consultation or session online",
    "Check location and contact details quickly on mobile"
  ],
  "commercial_risk_if_unaddressed": "Without an online booking pathway or regularly updated content, prospective clients who find Core Health through search or referral have no direct next step — they are likely to contact a competitor who makes it easier to act. The absence of a content section also limits ongoing search visibility in a vertical where educational authority directly supports new client acquisition.",
  "strongest_positioning_angle": "Core Health and Performance has an exceptional 5.0 Google rating across 53 reviews — a rare trust asset in the health and wellness space — but the current site offers no way to convert that reputation into booked consultations or sessions.",
  "top_3_outreach_talking_points": [
    "Your 5.0 Google rating is one of the strongest trust signals we see in the fitness space — we can help you surface that on your website and connect it directly to a booking pathway so prospective clients can act on it immediately.",
    "Health and wellness businesses that add a content section covering tips, client success stories, or service updates consistently see improvements in local search visibility — this is the most practical step to grow organic traffic without paid advertising.",
    "Adding an online consultation or session booking system removes a key friction point for new clients — many people searching for fitness support will move on quickly if they cannot take a direct next step from your website."
  ],
  "likely_objections": [
    "We already have a website and it works fine for us",
    "Most of our new clients come from word of mouth or Instagram",
    "We tried a booking system before and it was more hassle than it was worth",
    "We are too busy running the business to focus on the website right now"
  ],
  "recommended_offer_angle": "Position an entry-point offer around a content and booking package: a simple blog setup and an integrated consultation booking system, framed as a growth package for health and wellness businesses. This directly addresses both audit gaps and is easy to scope for a fixed-price proposal.",
  "unknowns_to_clarify": [
    "Is there an existing social media presence that could be linked to the website and used as a source for initial blog content?",
    "Is the business currently taking bookings by phone or email — and how many enquiries per week does this generate?",
    "Are Google Reviews dynamically embedded on the site or displayed manually — confirming this determines the complexity of the trust signal improvement",
    "Is the business open to a phased approach — booking system first, content section second — or does the owner prefer a single combined project?"
